# Orienter Express
Orienter Express is an extension for SketchUp that provides tools for aligning and orienting group/component copies along edges and vertices. Users can easily position and align group/component copies in SketchUp based on specific edge orientations and vertex positions, improving their workflow efficiency.

# Tools
Each tool in Orienter Express offers unique functionality to enhance the alignment, positioning, and scaling of group/component copies in SketchUp. These tools provide a convenient and efficient workflow for achieving accurate and consistent results in your design projects.

## Alignment Tool
The Alignment Tool in Orienter Express enables users to align group/component copies along selected edges with precision. By ensuring the origin and Z-axis orientation, this tool simplifies the process of positioning copies in SketchUp.

## Center Placement Tool
The Center Placement Tool allows users to effortlessly place group/component copies at the center of selected edges. It maintains the origin and Z-axis orientation, making it convenient to create symmetrical arrangements or precise placements.

## Scaling Tool (Z-axis)
The Scaling Tool (Z-axis) in Orienter Express provides the ability to scale group/component copies based on the length of each selected edge. This tool ensures consistent scaling along the Z-axis, maintaining proportionality and preserving the desired orientation.

## Uniform Scaling Tool
The Uniform Scaling Tool in Orienter Express allows for uniform scaling of group/component copies based on the length of selected edges. By maintaining the aspect ratio, it ensures uniform scaling along all three axes, resulting in proportional and correctly oriented copies.

## Vertex Placement Tool
With the Vertex Placement Tool, users can easily position group/component copies at the vertices of selected edges. This tool simplifies the placement process and allows for precise positioning based on specific vertex locations.
